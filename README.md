# RSync - Third party IDE support for ROBLOX Studio
RSync is an open source ROBLOX plugin that easily integrates any third-party code editor or IDE, such as Sublime Text, Notepad++, VS Code, or Atom, into ROBLOX Studio. This is accomplished via a helper application which runs in the tray and acts as a middle man between your code editor of choice and ROBLOX Studio.

## Download
Available in the [releases section.](https://github.com/evaera/RSync/releases)

## Installation 
RSync is designed with simplicity in mind: just download the executable and run it, and it will automatically install the plugin into ROBLOX Studio. Just let the application run in the tray while you're developing. 

RSync is designed to work on Windows only.

**Note**: If you already have Studio open when you run the application for the first time, you will need to restart Studio for the plugin to load.
